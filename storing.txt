also, it doesnt not remember anything.. make it remember and store date like i just add it and do my stuff and when i refresh it forgets everything like everythign make it remove no stuff until someone manually does 



make it display a small ui ux cool looking simple and minimalistic, time and date at top right.
and save the history according based on that time and date like exact when it happened
and also create a script that record every client side change with timestamp of time and date like if new element(teacher or class) is added then it records it and it all is stored in a single txt file which is easy to read as well 



add a new feature, where i can freely and easily edit every input of teachers and class like there would be an edit button beside the preexisting remove button and by clicking on it a small side menu is opened for me to edit and save the changes

also, it doesnt not remember anything.. make it remember and store date like i just add it and do my stuff and when i refresh it forgets everything like everythign make it remove no stuff until someone manually does 
add a new feature where i can make my own custom scenarios of having custom contstrains
for example, i want it such that no class will have maths period after lunch break
so i can add a constrain with predefined guides to help me 
and also hints to do it nicely
add a feature for each input element that is of teachers and student that it can mbe edited... presently it can only be removed but make it such that it can be edited as well without any errors



make a new type of framework such that the app.py runs in terminal but that erminal is seprately run like i want this app to be used using console too
but that console must be synced with web app like if i do some changes or load some custom data during the time i open web app then the same information log and things should be saved by terminal as well.
like list each feature and each feature of the web app should be made possible to the terminal aswell and each action and possibility too and the terminal should require less experience like should be very user friendly customizable and must generate correct stuff and things and output is gonan be plane text so it better be color and prepare a whole freaking manual to use the terminal in a seperate pdf file and also pave a way for future users to edit things like make it super user friendly to apply logics like user can easily from the terminal ask it to apply logic such that there is no science period as the last one.. just by typing few commands in the terminal
